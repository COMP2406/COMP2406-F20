# Submitted Practice Problems
### Submitted by: Dave McKenney (you can include this but don't need to, as long as the directory name matches your cuLearn name)

### Introduction:
There aren't any actual problems here. It is just an example of the required file structure. When submitting practice problems, put all of the required material in a directory that has your full name (matching cuLearn) and a title for the problems. Do not put spaces in the directory and file names, use a - instead.

Other students that wish to submit solutions to these problems can do so by adding a directory with their name within this directory.
