What I brought up:

- Basic questions about some of the topics to get more clarification, since I'm still very new to absolutely all of this. 

What I learned:

- I'd say 95% of this stuff is still new to me so I learned basically all of it. I learned about a lot of different tips and tricks to use. A lot of the tools that were brought up interested me (specifically things like bootstrap and other frameworks) so I'm going to be doing more research into those to use them for my project.
