## Notes for Session 1 (Sept. 19)

Personal Contributions:
- Asked about the advantages of various CSS size units (px, %, em etc.)
- Asked about the best way to animate HTML elements
- Provided an explaination of the concept of keyframes
- Asked for clarification on the "Game Replay" requirement in the Connect 4 project
- Asked about the importance of ensuring that JS-generated HTML is well formatted and readable

Personal Take-aways:
- Bootstrap is essentially a CSS library which will minimize the tedious and pedantic type of styling
- CSS can use relative or absolute size units (mainly px and %)
- % can be used to create a flexible webpage whereas % should be used sparingly for minor visual touches
- CSS can be used to animate elements with keyframe-like behavior
- JS-generated HTML (to make annoying grids or tables etc.) can be made to look decent when viewed in source with not very much effort
- JSON is a nice way of turning JS objects into strings (useful for databases)
- GET and POST are two of the most important commands when communicating with databases
- AJAX is an asynchronous way of updating your webpage contents without reloading
- Websockets are a more efficient way for servers to send news to users since it revolves around listening rather than constant requesting
