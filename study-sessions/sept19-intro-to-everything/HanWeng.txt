Tasks done today: Ask questions about what Ajax and Websockets are, difference between
local JSON files and databases. 

Ajax, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, techiques used to create asnychhronous applications

Web Socket; longpole; the client won't have to constantly ask the server if someone send 
a message to it yet. Like a phone sends notifications to you that someone messaged you then
constantly check the screen for messages.

Typescript: Superset of js, better development time tool to use

Browsers: different browsers can react differently to html/css/js but thats very common.

firefox and chrome are pretty similar

Learned about Verly.js which can be useful to mimick gravity

Bootstrap is pretty useful for frontend usage

JSON JavaScript Object Notation, open standard file format, and data interchange format, 
meant to store readable data. Uses key-value style of data great way to store local data 
without using any databases

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol: gets webpages data for the server using server-client 
model. 

postman: a great website for debugging website errors and free to use

REST API; Representational state transfer, for  handling  requests frontend webservice. 
Sends responses to clients. 

Local JSON file vs Database: local files for faster response but hard to organize and 
databases are easier to organize and find data.

POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

GET is one of the best way to request servers for data
