# My Role
I was the host, but I also did the majority of the talking/answering questions/demos. Topics were mostly results of tangents from questions. 
# Topics
We essentially covered at a shallow level everything in the first 75% of the course. Below are some topics.
## HTML/CSS of some sites
Looked at the layout of several sites, including google.com, and w3.com, and disdscussed some of the styling and how the site was implemented. Eg. The apps menu on the google home page is an iframe. Looked at hand written HTML on w3, and the framework generated html on other sites, like the login page of my final project, just to show what kind of code a framework might generate. 
## Frameworks
Discussed the usefullness of a CSS framework, how it would save time coding, and discussed the use of front end frameworks in project check in 1. Dispelled myth that they were dissallowed,
## CSS Animations
Looked at some pure CSS animations, and drew parallels with video, and flash animations. Looked at some bad examples I had written before. 
## Bad Practices
Talked about code golf, some anecdotes from my past, and a little bit of security
## Typescript/Javascript
Explained the type system in javascript, and how you can do some unepected things. Played around with jsfuck a little, to show that javascript can do funky things. Showed some typescript and some of the errors it shows. Explained how these can prevent bugs.
## Javascript and the DOM
Discussed how to use JS to add elements to a page, with both appendTo and innerHtml methods. Discussed why storing/contructing a string with innerhtml is a bad idea for maintainability.
## HTTP/AJAX/Express
This was a big one. Talked about different HTTP verbs, did a quick recap of JSON, and some examples. Created a hello world express server with GET and POST support, to demonstrate how data flows over HTTP. Showed POST and GET requests used on google's home page, and inspected the sent and recieved data.
## Websockets
Talked about how HTTP isn't great for being notified of server side events, and compared long/short polling and websockets, to checking for a package in the mail. Showed an example of long polling, in the timings tab of firefox dev tools
## Databases
Briefly compared and contrasted MongoDB with sql (MySQL). Showed demo of altering where clause, and the fields in a SQL select statement, to show data being effectively filtered.
## Implementation Details of Final Projects
Talked about features of various final projects, like using websockets for real time graphs for the stock broker or having a database for the Movie DB.
## Sessions
Talked briefly about how sessions work, and how they avoid storing username and password in the browser.
## Other Stuff
 - Explored a JS Physics Engine
 - Discussed Vendor tags in CSS
## Admin
 - Discussed github submissions, and a system to keep track of attendance and report submission.
 - May shorten meetings in the future.
